# Budgetwise Intern Challenge

## Overview

I completed the Budgetwise Intern Challenge, where I implemented a functional front-end for a specific portion of the app's Home Page module. This portion focuses on the budget breakdown feature, allowing users to manage their budgets, track spending, and add transactions.

## Completed Work

I successfully implemented the following features as part of the challenge:

- Created the budget breakdown section of the Home Page using Kotlin and adhering to the provided Figma design assets.
- Implemented the distribution of spending categories, accurately reflecting the allocated budgets for each category.
- Enabled users to add transactions to each spending category, dynamically updating the spending and budget distribution.
- Designed the interface to be visually appealing and consistent with the provided Figma designs.

## Design Assets

I referred to the provided Figma design assets throughout the implementation process. These assets guided me in terms of layout, colors, typography, and overall design aesthetics.

## Key Points

- The displayed spending amounts accurately correspond to the numbers used in the categories, ensuring accurate representation.
- Each spending category supports the addition of transactions, with the spending and budget distribution updating accordingly.
- To enhance the user experience, I added a subtle animation that showcases the bar growing when a transaction is added. This provides visual feedback to users.

## Getting Started

1. To view my completed work, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cultofthedamned/Budgetwise-Intern-Challenge.git`
2. Open the project in any Kotlin development environment.
3. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.
4. Navigate to the Home Page to interact with the budget breakdown feature.

## Demonstration

I have provided a screen recording that demonstrates the functional feature in action, showcasing the process of adding transactions. Please refer to the attached video for a comprehensive overview of the implemented functionality.
